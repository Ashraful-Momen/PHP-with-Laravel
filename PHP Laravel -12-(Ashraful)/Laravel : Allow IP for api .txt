To restrict access to a specific route based on an IP address in Laravel, you can use middleware. Laravel allows you to create custom middleware where you can add logic to check if the request is coming from a specific IP address.

Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### 1. **Create a custom middleware**
First, create a new middleware using Artisan:

```bash
php artisan make:middleware RestrictIpMiddleware
```

This will create a file in `app/Http/Middleware/RestrictIpMiddleware.php`. Now, open this file and modify it to check for the allowed IP address.

### 2. **Modify the middleware**

In the `handle` method of the `RestrictIpMiddleware.php` file, add logic to restrict access by IP:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class RestrictIpMiddleware
{
    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param  \Illuminate\Http\Request  $request
     * @param  \Closure  $next
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Replace '123.123.123.123' with the allowed IP address
        $allowedIp = '123.123.123.123';

        if ($request->ip() !== $allowedIp) {
            return response()->json(['error' => 'Unauthorized'], 403);
        }

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

### 3. **Register the middleware**

Next, you need to register the middleware in the `app/Http/Kernel.php` file. Add it to the `$routeMiddleware` array:

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // other middleware
    'restrict.ip' => \App\Http\Middleware\RestrictIpMiddleware::class,
];
```

### 4. **Apply the middleware to the route**

Now, in your `api.php` file, apply the middleware to the specific route:

```php
Route::post('/tele_medicine/deregister', [TeleMedicineCustomerController::class, 'customer_deregister'])
    ->name('customer_deregister')
    ->middleware('restrict.ip');
```

### 5. **Test the route**

Now, the `/tele_medicine/deregister` route will only be accessible from the allowed IP (`123.123.123.123` in this example). All other IP addresses will receive a `403 Unauthorized` response.

You can replace `123.123.123.123` with the actual IP address you want to allow.
