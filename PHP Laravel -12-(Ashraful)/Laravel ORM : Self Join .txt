Hereâ€™s a **note on SELF JOIN** with a simple explanation, ASCII diagram, and Laravel ORM example:

---

### **SELF JOIN in SQL**

A **SELF JOIN** is a join where a table is joined with itself. It is useful when you want to relate rows within the same table. To perform a self join, you need to give the table two different aliases to distinguish the two instances.

---

### **ASCII Representation**

Imagine a table called `employees` that contains employee data. We want to match employees with their managers, assuming the `manager_id` column references another employee's `id` in the same table.

```
EMPLOYEES (Self Join)
+----+-----------+------------+
| ID | Name      | Manager_ID |
+----+-----------+------------+
| 1  | Alice     | NULL       |
| 2  | Bob       | 1          |
| 3  | Charlie   | 1          |
| 4  | David     | 2          |
+----+-----------+------------+

SELF JOIN Result (Finding Managers for Each Employee):
+----+-----------+------------+-----------+---------+
| ID | Name      | Manager_ID | ManagerID | Manager |
+----+-----------+------------+-----------+---------+
| 1  | Alice     | NULL       | NULL      | NULL    |
| 2  | Bob       | 1          | 1         | Alice   |
| 3  | Charlie   | 1          | 1         | Alice   |
| 4  | David     | 2          | 2         | Bob     |
+----+-----------+------------+-----------+---------+
```

In this example, we use a self join to relate each employee to their manager.

### **SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT e1.id, e1.name AS employee, e2.name AS manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2
ON e1.manager_id = e2.id;
```

In this case:
- `e1` is the alias for the employee data.
- `e2` is the alias for the manager data.
- The `manager_id` in `e1` refers to `id` in `e2`, linking employees to their managers.

---

### **SELF JOIN in Laravel ORM**

#### Query Builder Syntax:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

$results = DB::table('employees as e1') // First instance of the table (employee)
    ->leftJoin('employees as e2', 'e1.manager_id', '=', 'e2.id') // Second instance of the table (manager)
    ->select('e1.id', 'e1.name as employee', 'e2.name as manager') // Specify the columns to select
    ->get();
```

#### Output:

```php
[
    { "id": 1, "employee": "Alice", "manager": null },
    { "id": 2, "employee": "Bob", "manager": "Alice" },
    { "id": 3, "employee": "Charlie", "manager": "Alice" },
    { "id": 4, "employee": "David", "manager": "Bob" }
]
```

Each employee is matched with their manager (if available) based on the `manager_id`.

### **Notes**
1. **Self Join**: A self join is used to join a table with itself. You need to use aliases to differentiate the instances of the same table.
2. **LEFT JOIN**: Typically, a LEFT JOIN is used in a self join to ensure that all rows from the "employee" table are returned, even if there is no matching manager.
3. Use **Eloquent ORM** when working with models, or **DB query builder** for raw table access.

---

### **Multiple SELF JOIN Example**

To perform a **SELF JOIN** with more than two instances of the same table in Laravel, you can chain the `leftJoin()` method multiple times.

#### MySQL Query:

```sql
SELECT e1.id, e1.name AS employee, e2.name AS manager, e3.name AS grand_manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.id
LEFT JOIN employees e3 ON e2.manager_id = e3.id;
```

#### Laravel Query Builder:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

$results = DB::table('employees as e1')
    ->leftJoin('employees as e2', 'e1.manager_id', '=', 'e2.id') // First LEFT JOIN (Manager)
    ->leftJoin('employees as e3', 'e2.manager_id', '=', 'e3.id') // Second LEFT JOIN (Grand Manager)
    ->select('e1.id', 'e1.name as employee', 'e2.name as manager', 'e3.name as grand_manager') // Specify columns
    ->get();
```

---

### **Summary**
1. **SELF JOIN**: Joins a table with itself to relate rows within the same table.
2. **Aliases**: Use aliases for the same table to differentiate the different instances.
3. **LEFT JOIN**: Helps ensure all rows from the primary table are returned, even if there is no matching data in the second instance (e.g., no manager for an employee).
4. Use the `leftJoin()` method in Laravel to perform a self join and relate entities within the same table.
