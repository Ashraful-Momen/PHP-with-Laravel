Here's the mathematical formula for calculating comprehensive motorcycle insurance:

Let FIV = Full Insured Value of the motorcycle

1. Basic Components Formula:
```
Basic Premium = BDT 200 (fixed)
Own Damage = FIV × 0.0115
Cyclone & Flood = FIV × 0.0025
Earthquake = FIV × 0.0025
Riot & Strike = FIV × 0.005
```

2. Gross Own Damage Premium Formula:
```
Gross Own Damage Premium = Basic Premium + Own Damage + Cyclone & Flood + Earthquake + Riot & Strike
```

3. Liability Coverage Formula:
```
Act Liability = BDT 100 (fixed)
Passenger Liability = BDT 45 × 1 passenger
Driver Liability = BDT 50 (fixed for 1 driver)
```

4. Net Premium Formula:
```
Net Premium = Gross Own Damage Premium + Act Liability + Passenger Liability + Driver Liability
```

5. Final Premium Formula:
```
VAT = Net Premium × 0.15
Gross Premium = Net Premium + VAT
```

Combined Single Formula:
```
Gross Premium = [(200 + (FIV × 0.0115) + (FIV × 0.0025) + (FIV × 0.0025) + (FIV × 0.005)) + 100 + 45 + 50] × 1.15
```

Simplified Formula:
```
Gross Premium = [200 + (FIV × 0.0215) + 195] × 1.15
```
Where:
- FIV is the Full Insured Value of your motorcycle
- 0.0215 is the combined rate (1.15% + 0.25% + 0.25% + 0.5%)
- 195 is the total fixed charges (100 + 45 + 50)
- 1.15 represents the 15% VAT addition
