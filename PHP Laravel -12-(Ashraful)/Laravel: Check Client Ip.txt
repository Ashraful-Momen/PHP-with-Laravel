In Laravel, you can easily retrieve the client's IP address from a request using the `Request` object.

Here’s how you can do it:

### 1. **Using the `Request` facade**

In your route or controller, you can use the `ip()` method from the `Request` object to get the client’s IP address.

#### **In a Route Closure:**
```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Request;

Route::get('/check-ip', function () {
    $clientIp = Request::ip(); // Get the client's IP address
    return $clientIp;
});
```

#### **In a Controller:**
```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class YourController extends Controller
{
    public function yourMethod(Request $request)
    {
        $clientIp = $request->ip(); // Get the client's IP address
        return $clientIp;
    }
}
```

### 2. **Additional Methods**
You can also use `request()` helper:

#### **In a Route:**
```php
Route::get('/check-ip', function () {
    $clientIp = request()->ip(); // Get the client's IP address
    return $clientIp;
});
```

### Notes:
- Laravel's `ip()` method will correctly return the client IP even behind proxies by checking `X-Forwarded-For` headers if configured properly.
- If you are using services like Cloudflare or other proxy servers, make sure to handle IP forwarding correctly.
