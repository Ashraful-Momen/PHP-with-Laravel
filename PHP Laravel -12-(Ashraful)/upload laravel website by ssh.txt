upload laravel website with ssh
ChatGPT

To upload your Laravel website using SSH (Secure Shell), you can follow these general steps:

    Connect to your server: Use an SSH client like Terminal (Mac/Linux) or PuTTY (Windows) to connect to your server. You'll need the server's IP address, username, and password (or SSH key if you're using key-based authentication).

    sh

ssh username@server_ip

Navigate to the directory where your website files will be stored: Usually, this is the web server's root directory. For example, if you're using Apache, it might be /var/www/html or for Nginx, it might be /usr/share/nginx/html.

sh

cd /var/www/html

Transfer your Laravel files to the server: You can use scp (secure copy) command to transfer files from your local machine to the server. Make sure you replace path/to/your/local/laravel/project with the path to your local Laravel project directory.

sh

scp -r path/to/your/local/laravel/project/* username@server_ip:/var/www/html

This command will recursively copy all files and directories from your local Laravel project to the server.

Set permissions: Ensure that the appropriate permissions are set for directories and files in your Laravel project. Typically, you would want to set the storage and bootstrap/cache directories to be writable by the web server. You can use the following commands:

sh

chmod -R 775 storage
chmod -R 775 bootstrap/cache

Install Composer dependencies: SSH into your server and navigate to your Laravel project directory. Then run composer install to install the dependencies specified in your composer.json file.

sh

cd /var/www/html
composer install

Configure environment variables: Make sure your .env file is properly configured with the database settings and other environment variables required by your Laravel application.

Set up the web server: Depending on the web server you're using (Apache or Nginx), you may need to configure a virtual host to point to your Laravel project's public directory.

Restart the web server: After making any configuration changes to the web server, restart it to apply the changes.

For Apache:

sh

sudo service apache2 restart

For Nginx:

sh

    sudo service nginx restart

    Verify: Once everything is set up, visit your website in a web browser to verify that it's working correctly.

These steps should guide you through the process of uploading your Laravel website using SSH. Make sure to replace placeholder values with your actual server details and paths.

for download : sudo scp root@36.255.70.101:/var/www/html/microsite/17-3-24-instaweb.zip /home/shuvo/Downloads 

for upload : sudo scp -r /home/shuvo/Laravel7/* root@36.255.70.101:/var/www/html/microsite/17-3-24-instaweb.zip

=======================================solve the permission error : storage files======================================

The error message indicates that the Laravel application does not have the necessary permissions to write to the log file located at /var/www/html/microsite/storage/logs/laravel.log. To fix this issue, you need to grant write permissions to the storage directory and its subdirectories.

You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

bash

cd /root/var/www/html/microsite_last/
chmod -R 775 storage

This command recursively changes the permissions of the storage directory and its subdirectories to allow read, write, and execute permissions for the owner and group, and read and execute permissions for others.

After running these commands, try accessing your Laravel website again. If the issue persists, make sure that the web server user (such as www-data for Apache) has ownership of the storage directory. You can change the ownership using the chown command:

bash

chown -R www-data:www-data storage

Replace www-data:www-data with the appropriate user and group if your web server is running under a different user and group.

After changing permissions and ownership, try accessing your Laravel website again. If you encounter any further issues, check the Laravel logs for more detailed error messages to help diagnose the problem.
