Great! I'll help you connect your S3 cloud storage from Brilliant.com.bd to your Laravel project. Here are the steps:

1. First, make sure you have the S3 package installed:

```bash
composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3
```

2. Update your `.env` file with the S3 credentials:

```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key_here
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_BUCKET=instasure
AWS_URL=https://s3.brilliant.com.bd
AWS_ENDPOINT=https://s3.brilliant.com.bd
AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT=true
```

3. Your `config/filesystem.php` is already correctly configured, but you should modify the existing 's3' disk configuration in your `.env` file with your specific credentials.

4. Since you're using a custom S3 endpoint (not from AWS), add this important line to your filesystem configuration:

```php
's3' => [
    'driver' => 's3',
    'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
    'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'),
    'bucket' => env('AWS_BUCKET'),
    'url' => env('AWS_URL'),
    'endpoint' => env('AWS_ENDPOINT'),
    'use_path_style_endpoint' => env('AWS_USE_PATH_STYLE_ENDPOINT', false), // Add this line
],
```

5. To test the connection, create a simple route or controller method:

```php
Route::get('/test-s3', function() {
    try {
        // Try to put a test file
        Storage::disk('s3')->put('test.txt', 'Hello S3 Storage!');
        
        // Check if the file exists
        $exists = Storage::disk('s3')->exists('test.txt');
        
        // Get the file
        $content = Storage::disk('s3')->get('test.txt');
        
        return [
            'success' => true,
            'exists' => $exists,
            'content' => $content
        ];
    } catch (\Exception $e) {
        return [
            'success' => false,
            'message' => $e->getMessage()
        ];
    }
});
```

6. To use this S3 storage for file uploads, here's an example:

```php
public function uploadFile(Request $request)
{
    if ($request->hasFile('file')) {
        $file = $request->file('file');
        $fileName = time() . '_' . $file->getClientOriginalName();
        
        // Store the file on S3
        $path = Storage::disk('s3')->putFileAs(
            'uploads', // This is the folder on S3
            $file,
            $fileName
        );
        
        // Get the URL for the file
        $url = Storage::disk('s3')->url($path);
        
        return response()->json(['url' => $url]);
    }
    
    return response()->json(['error' => 'No file uploaded'], 400);
}
```

7. If you want to make this S3 storage your default cloud storage, ensure in your `.env` file you have:

```
FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=s3
FILESYSTEM_CLOUD=s3
```

8. For public files, you might need to set the visibility:

```php
// To store a public file
Storage::disk('s3')->put('public/image.jpg', $fileContents, 'public');

// Or set visibility after storing
Storage::disk('s3')->setVisibility('path/to/file.jpg', 'public');
```

Keep in mind that for `endpoint` values, you should use the HTTPS endpoint (https://s3.brilliant.com.bd) rather than the HTTP one for better security, unless your application specifically requires HTTP.

Would you like me to guide you through any specific operation with your S3 storage, like uploading files or managing permissions?
