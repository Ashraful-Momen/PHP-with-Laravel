To set an API header in the Chrome browser using a Chrome extension, you can use an extension like "ModHeader" or "Requestly." Hereâ€™s how you can do it with both:

Using ModHeader
Install ModHeader:

Go to the Chrome Web Store.
Search for "ModHeader".
Click "Add to Chrome" and confirm the installation.
Set the Header:

Click on the ModHeader extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
Click "Add" to create a new profile if needed.
In the "Request Headers" section, add a new header.
Enter the header name and value. For example, for an API key, you might use Authorization as the name and Bearer <your_api_key> as the value.
The header will now be added to all outgoing requests made by the browser.
Using Requestly
Install Requestly:

Go to the Chrome Web Store.
Search for "Requestly".
Click "Add to Chrome" and confirm the installation.
Set the Header:

Click on the Requestly extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
Click on "New Rule" and select "Modify Headers".
Choose "Request Headers" and click "Add".
Enter the header name and value. For example, for an API key, you might use Authorization as the name and Bearer <your_api_key> as the value.
Specify the URL pattern where the header should be applied, or leave it generic for all URLs.
Save the rule. The header will now be added to all outgoing requests that match the specified pattern.
These extensions provide an easy way to modify request headers without needing to write any custom code or scripts.
