Certainly! Below is a simple example of how to implement a Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) system using Redis and Laravel. This example will cover the basics of setting up a Laravel project, integrating Redis, and creating a simple API to publish and subscribe to messages.

### Step 1: Set Up Laravel Project

First, create a new Laravel project if you don't already have one:

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel laravel-redis-pubsub
cd laravel-redis-pubsub
```

### Step 2: Install Redis

Install the Redis PHP extension and the Laravel Redis package:

```bash
pecl install redis
```

Add the Redis service provider in `config/app.php` (though it's usually auto-discovered):

```php
'providers' => [
    // Other service providers...
    Illuminate\Redis\RedisServiceProvider::class,
],
```

### Step 3: Configure Redis

Update your `.env` file to use Redis as the default cache and queue driver:

```env
CACHE_DRIVER=redis
QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis
REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
REDIS_PASSWORD=null
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

### Step 4: Create a Controller

Create a new controller to handle the Pub/Sub logic:

```bash
php artisan make:controller PubSubController
```

In `app/Http/Controllers/PubSubController.php`, add the following methods:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Redis;

class PubSubController extends Controller
{
    public function publish(Request $request)
    {
        $channel = $request->input('channel');
        $message = $request->input('message');

        Redis::publish($channel, json_encode($message));

        return response()->json(['status' => 'success', 'message' => 'Message published']);
    }

    public function subscribe(Request $request)
    {
        $channel = $request->input('channel');

        Redis::subscribe([$channel], function ($message) {
            echo "Message received: " . $message . "\n";
        });

        return response()->json(['status' => 'success', 'message' => 'Subscribed to channel']);
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Define Routes

Add the following routes to `routes/api.php`:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\PubSubController;

Route::post('/publish', [PubSubController::class, 'publish']);
Route::post('/subscribe', [PubSubController::class, 'subscribe']);
```

### Step 6: Test the API

You can test the API using tools like Postman or cURL.

#### Publish a Message

Send a POST request to `/api/publish` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
    "channel": "test-channel",
    "message": "Hello, Redis!"
}
```

#### Subscribe to a Channel

Send a POST request to `/api/subscribe` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
    "channel": "test-channel"
}
```

### Step 7: Running the Subscriber

Since the subscriber is a long-running process, you can run it using the Laravel Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

Then, in another terminal, you can use `curl` or Postman to send the subscribe request.

### Step 8: Testing the Pub/Sub

1. Open two terminal windows.
2. In the first terminal, run the Laravel server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

3. In the second terminal, use `curl` to subscribe to the channel:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/subscribe -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"channel": "test-channel"}'
    ```

4. In another terminal, publish a message:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/publish -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"channel": "test-channel", "message": "Hello, Redis!"}'
    ```

You should see the message printed in the terminal where the subscriber is running.

### Conclusion

This example covers the basics of setting up a Pub/Sub system using Redis and Laravel. You can expand on this by adding more features like authentication, logging, or even integrating with Laravel Events and Listeners for more complex workflows.

This setup should serve as a good foundation for your future projects involving real-time messaging and event-driven architectures.
