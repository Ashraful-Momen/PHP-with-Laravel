in the hasmanythrough relationship if we use many to many relationship then we have to use pivot table.

#project_table => user_table | using , Many to Many relationship => use project_user Pivot table.

-----------------------------------
and the relationship will be ->
#project_model belongstoMany User and user_model belongstoMany Project.

-----------------------------------
for Project_table to Task_table relationship ->  //Project table hasMany relationship with Task::class, through Team::class table.


hasmanythrough(Task::class,Team::class,'project_id','user_id','project_table_id','user_id');

->project_id for the Team::class. (pivot table)
->user_id for Task::clss.
->project_table_id for the current Project Table.
->user_id for the Team::class (pivot table)
