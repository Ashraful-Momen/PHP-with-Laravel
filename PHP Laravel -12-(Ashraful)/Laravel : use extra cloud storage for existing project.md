To use an additional 100GB cloud storage with a different IP for your existing Laravel project running on Nginx, you'll need to mount or integrate that storage with your application. I'll outline several approaches you can consider.

Let me search for some specific Laravel cloud storage integration methods to give you the most current information.

Now let me search for more specific information about integrating external storage with different IP addresses for Laravel:

Let me get some more specific information about SFTP and FTP adapters for Laravel:

Now let me check specifically for NFS mounting options:

Based on my research, there are several ways you can use your additional 100GB cloud storage with a different IP address for your existing Laravel project. I'll outline the three main approaches:

## Option 1: Use Laravel's Filesystem Configuration with SFTP/FTP

Laravel has built-in support for connecting to remote storage via FTP or SFTP. This is the most Laravel-native approach and doesn't require system-level changes.

1. First, install the required Flysystem adapter package:
   - For SFTP: `composer require league/flysystem-sftp-v3`
   - For FTP: Laravel includes FTP support by default

2. Configure your remote disk in `config/filesystems.php`:

```php
'disks' => [
    // Your existing disks...
    
    'remote' => [
        'driver' => 'sftp',
        'host' => env('REMOTE_HOST'), // Your storage server IP
        'username' => env('REMOTE_USERNAME'),
        'password' => env('REMOTE_PASSWORD'),
        // Optional SFTP settings
        'port' => env('REMOTE_PORT', 22),
        'root' => env('REMOTE_ROOT', '/path/on/remote/server'),
        'timeout' => 30,
    ],
]
```

3. Add these environment variables to your `.env` file:
```
REMOTE_HOST=your_storage_server_ip
REMOTE_USERNAME=your_username
REMOTE_PASSWORD=your_password
REMOTE_ROOT=/path/on/remote/server
```

4. Use it in your Laravel application:
```php
// Store a file
Storage::disk('remote')->put('filename.txt', $fileContents);

// Get a file
$contents = Storage::disk('remote')->get('filename.txt');
```

## Option 2: Mount the Remote Storage using NFS

NFS (Network File System) allows you to mount the remote storage directly to your server's filesystem, making it appear as if it's local storage.

1. On your storage server (with 100GB), set up NFS server:
```bash
sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
sudo mkdir -p /export/storage
# Add directory to exports
echo "/export/storage *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)" | sudo tee -a /etc/exports
sudo exportfs -a
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
```

2. On your application server, mount the NFS share:
```bash
sudo apt-get install nfs-common
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/remote-storage
sudo mount storage_server_ip:/export/storage /mnt/remote-storage
```

3. To make it permanent, add to `/etc/fstab`:
```
storage_server_ip:/export/storage /mnt/remote-storage nfs auto,nofail,noatime,nolock,intr,tcp,actimeo=1800 0 0
```

4. Configure Laravel to use this path in your `config/filesystems.php`:
```php
'disks' => [
    // Your existing disks...
    
    'remote' => [
        'driver' => 'local',
        'root' => '/mnt/remote-storage',
    ],
]
```

## Option 3: Use a Cloud Storage Adapter

If your 100GB storage supports S3-compatible APIs (like MinIO), you can use S3:

1. Install the S3 adapter:
```bash
composer require league/flysystem-aws-s3-v3
```

2. Configure in `config/filesystems.php`:
```php
's3' => [
    'driver' => 's3',
    'key' => env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
    'secret' => env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'),
    'region' => env('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'),
    'bucket' => env('AWS_BUCKET'),
    'url' => env('AWS_URL'),
    'endpoint' => env('AWS_ENDPOINT', 'https://your-storage-server-ip:port'),
],
```

## Recommendations

Based on your requirements:

1. **For simplicity**: Use the SFTP/FTP adapter (Option 1) if you just need to store and retrieve files. This is fully managed through Laravel and doesn't require system-level changes.

2. **For performance**: Use NFS mounting (Option 2) if you need high performance and want the remote storage to appear as if it's local. This is especially good if you have many small files.

3. **For reliability**: Use a cloud storage adapter (Option 3) if your 100GB storage supports S3-compatible APIs. This provides better reliability and scalability.

The SFTP option is the simplest to set up initially, but NFS might offer better performance for your Laravel application if file operations are frequent. Remember to set proper permissions on the remote storage to allow your web server user (usually www-data) to read and write files.
