Hereâ€™s a **note on CROSS JOIN** with a simple explanation, ASCII diagram, and Laravel ORM example:

---

### **CROSS JOIN in SQL**

A **CROSS JOIN** returns the **Cartesian product** of two tables. This means that it combines every row from the **first table** with every row from the **second table**. The result set will have a number of rows equal to the product of the number of rows in each table.

---

### **ASCII Representation**

```
TABLE1 (Left)                     TABLE2 (Right)
+----+-------+                   +----+-------+
| ID | Name  |                   | ID | Order |
+----+-------+                   +----+-------+
| 1  | Alice |                   | 1  | A123  |
| 2  | Bob   |                   | 2  | B456  |
+----+-------+                   +----+-------+

CROSS JOIN Result:
+----+---------+----+-------+
| ID | Name    | ID | Order |
+----+---------+----+-------+
| 1  | Alice   | 1  | A123  |
| 1  | Alice   | 2  | B456  |
| 2  | Bob     | 1  | A123  |
| 2  | Bob     | 2  | B456  |
+----+---------+----+-------+
```

In the example, every row from `TABLE1` is combined with every row from `TABLE2`, resulting in a total of `2 (from table1) * 2 (from table2) = 4` rows in the result.

---

### **SQL Query**

```sql
SELECT table1.id, table1.name, table2.id, table2.order
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
```

In this case, each row from `table1` is combined with each row from `table2`, giving the Cartesian product of both tables.

---

### **CROSS JOIN in Laravel ORM**

#### Query Builder Syntax:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

$results = DB::table('table1') // Left Table
    ->crossJoin('table2') // Right Table
    ->select('table1.id', 'table1.name', 'table2.id as order_id', 'table2.order') // Specify columns
    ->get();
```

#### Output:

```php
[
    { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "order_id": 1, "order": "A123" },
    { "id": 1, "name": "Alice", "order_id": 2, "order": "B456" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "order_id": 1, "order": "A123" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Bob", "order_id": 2, "order": "B456" }
]
```

Each row from `table1` is paired with each row from `table2` in the result.

---

### **Notes**
1. **CROSS JOIN**: Produces a Cartesian product of the two tables, combining every row from the first table with every row from the second table.
2. The result set contains all possible combinations of rows from the two tables.
3. **Use cases**: CROSS JOINs are rarely used in practice but can be useful for generating combinations or testing scenarios.
4. Use **Eloquent ORM** when working with models, or **DB query builder** for raw table access.

---

### **Multiple CROSS JOIN Example**

To perform a **CROSS JOIN** with multiple tables in Laravel, you can chain the `crossJoin()` methods.

#### MySQL Query:

```sql
SELECT table1.column_name, table2.column_name, table3.column_name
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2
CROSS JOIN table3;
```

#### Laravel Query Builder:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

$results = DB::table('table1')
    ->crossJoin('table2') // First CROSS JOIN
    ->crossJoin('table3') // Second CROSS JOIN
    ->select('table1.column_name as col1', 'table2.column_name as col2', 'table3.column_name as col3') // Select desired columns
    ->get();
```

---

### **Summary**
1. **CROSS JOIN**: Combines each row of the first table with each row of the second table, producing the Cartesian product.
2. This results in a total number of rows equal to the product of the number of rows in each table.
3. CROSS JOIN is less commonly used but useful for generating all possible combinations or for specific analytical purposes.
4. Use the `crossJoin()` method in Laravel to perform this type of join.
